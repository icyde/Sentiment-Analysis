In this project, the team explores what was taught in the last 4 weeks of the machine
learning module, 50.007. Parts 1 to 3 was a semi guided implementation of a sequence
labelling model for informal texts such as those from Twitter or Weibo, in this case, the
texts chosen were in the languages of Spanish and Russian. This was done via Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) and specifically its Viterbi algorithm.

In part 4 of the project, the team was tasked with improving the sentiment analysis
system. The main change that the team did was to improve the pre-processing of data
in order to have cleaner, less noisy data for the model to learn from. In addition, a
pseudo-character level language model was also implemented as an attempt to
improve the score as an alternative to dealing with Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) words.
